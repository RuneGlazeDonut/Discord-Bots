### Community-Wide Bots
All my Bots are Community-Wide - Meaning everything is shared amongst members of your Server.

### Work as a Team
The reason for this is so your Server (Community) works together to reach goals, skill for items, etc.

### Free to use
Just invite a Bot, easy as that.

### Development
Go to [the Project Page](https://github.com/RuneGlazeDonut/Discord-Bots/projects) to view the Development of the Bots.

Also take a quick look at [the Terms of Service](https://www.rea1m.ca/discord-bots/tos) and
[Privacy Policy](https://www.rea1m.ca/discord-bots/privacy) for the Bots.
